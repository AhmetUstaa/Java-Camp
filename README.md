# Extra tips about Day 1 works on lesson and homework;

> In the Java programming language, variable names are written as **camelCase**.

> **(i++)** means to every single action **increase** to (i) by 1. As you might have guessed **(i--)** means about **decreasing** by 1.

> You have to be careful about this scenario. You have to write code like this **System.out.println(variableName)** when you try to print any variable. Not like this **System.out.println("variableName")**. If you want to try, try if you dare.

> Java is a **Case Sensitive** language. Which means *variable = "a"* different between *variable = "A"*.

> Reusability is an important method in programming. 

> Variable names should be clear for readability when performing reverse engineering activities. Abbreviations should be avoided.

> Some information about **Data Types**.

|Data Type| 	Size 	|Description|Example|Notes|
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|-----|
|byte| 	1 byte |	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127|byte number = 127;||
|short| 	2 bytes 	|Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767|short number = 32767; ||
|int| 	4 bytes 	|Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|int number = 1881;||
|long 	|8 bytes 	|Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|long tcIdNumber = 12345678910|Best practice it should be the String|
|float 	|4 bytes 	|Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits|float number = -0,05; ||
|double |	8 bytes 	|Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits|long number = 0,01234567897894561;||
|boolean |	1 bit 	|Stores true or false values|boolean isThatTrue = true;||
|char 	|2 bytes 	|Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values|char value = 'J';|Should be '', ASCII|


> Should be use **==** when you want to **control** about equal **condition**, otherwise an equal symbol is to assign a value.

> About Defensive Programming;

    1- Never trust user datas and inputs. 
    2- Determine the data types. Double-check is necessary.
    3- When the developer changes, the way they work and their attention will not be the same. Have the written methods checked at each layer.
    4- Follow the SOLID rules. [Also check](https://gokhana.medium.com/solid-nedir-solid-yaz%C4%B1l%C4%B1m-prensipleri-nelerdir-40fb9450408e)
        - S ----> Single Responsibility
        - O ----> Open / Closed
        - L ----> Liskov's Substitution
        - I ----> Interface Segregation
        - D ----> Dependency Inversion

  > You can write codes like this when you want to give to user same output sometimes;
  
        case 'B':
	case 'C':
