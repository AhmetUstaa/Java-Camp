# Extra tips about Day 1 works on lesson and homework;

> In the Java programming language, variable names are written as **camelCase**.

> **(i++)** means to every single action increase to (i) by 1. As you might have guessed **(i--)** means about decreasing by 1.

> You have to be careful about this scenario. You have to write code like this **System.out.println(variableName)** when you try to print any variable. Not like this **System.out.println("variableName")**. If you want to try, try if you dare.

> Java is a **Case Sensitive** language. Which means variable "a" different between variable "A".
